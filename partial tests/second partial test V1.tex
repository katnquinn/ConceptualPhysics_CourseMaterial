You are free to use all notes on your two-sided cheat sheet. There are extra blank sheets at the end, which can be used for calculations, and if you require more please ask and be sure to include them when you hand back the test. Please be sure to include all your work and calculations.

There are \numquestions~problems for a total of \numpoints~points. (One of the questions is a bonus though.)

\begin{questions}
\question \textbf{Drawing Field Lines:} Six particles are arranged on a hexagon. They all have identical masses. Some are positively charged, and some are negatively charged. They all have charge of $\pm 1$ (so the size of all charges are the same).

\begin{parts}

\part[2] Draw the \textbf{electric field} lines around the particles. If there is a point with \textbf{zero} electric field, indicated it on the diagram.

\question \textbf{Alien Planet:} On a distant planet, aliens have set up a monitoring post with two lasers that are distance \textit{D} apart. They see a spaceship traveling at 1/3 the speed of light, passing over their lasers and decide to fire at the ship, creating scorch marks on the ship's hull. T\textbf{he image below shows this setup from the perspective of an alien on the planet.}

	\begin{parts}
		\part[2] The aliens on the planet fire the lasers at the same time. How far apart would they say the scorch marks on the ship are?

				\choice Exactly a distance \textit{D} apart.
				\choice A distance greater than \textit{D} apart.
				\choice A distance less than \textit{D} apart.
			\end{choices}

				\choice Exactly a distance \textit{D} apart.
				\choice A distance greater than \textit{D} apart.
				\choice A distance less than \textit{D} apart.
			\end{choices}
		\part[2] An alien on the planet says that the laser beams strike the ship simultaneously. Would an alien on the ship agree?
			\begin{choices}
				\choice Yes, the lasers were fired at the same time and so they would agree.
				\choice No, they would say the beam from laser A struck first.
				\choice No, they would say the beam from laser B struck first.

\question \textbf{Quark Energies:} Quarks are elementary particles (meaning that, to our knowledge, they cannot be broken down). Three quarks can come together to make up a proton or a neutron, and because there are different kinds of quarks the different combinations can yield different particles. There are 6 different quarks, each with a different mass:

\begin{tabular}{l l }
	up quark & $4.30 \times 10^{-30}$ kg \\
	down quark & $8.59 \times 10^{-30}$ kg \\
	charm quark & $2.28 \times 10^{-27}$ kg\\
	strange quark & $1.70 \times 10^{-28}$ kg \\
	top quark & $3.09 \times 10^{-25}$ kg \\
	bottom quark & $7.48 \times 10^{-27}$ kg
\end{tabular}

\begin{parts}
	\part[2] Considering Einstein's equation which relates mass to energy, $E=mc^2$, which quark has the \textbf{most} mass-energy?
		\vspace{0.5in}
	\part[2] Considering Einstein's equation which relates mass to energy, $E=mc^2$, which quark has the \textbf{least} mass-energy?
		\vspace{0.5in}
	\part[2] By the principle of wave-particle duality, we know that these different quarks also have different wavelengths. Below are six different waves (shown with decreasing wavelength), which represent the wavelengths of these different quarks (assuming their velocities are negligible). Label them.

\question \textbf{Black Holes:} Suppose scientists on Earth decide to launch two satellites at a black hole. Both satellites are identical, and transmit information via radio waves, which observers on Earth can detect. Both satellites are in an identical orbit around the black hole (so \textit{they are stationary with respect to each other}), just outside the event horizon.
