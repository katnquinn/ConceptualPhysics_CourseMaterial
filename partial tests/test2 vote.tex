\noindent{\LARGE Conceptual Physics \\ Vote for Second Partial Test\\}
\end{center}

\vspace{0.5in}

During the secont partial test next week, you will take the same test twice: First individually, then in groups of 3. Your grade for the test will be either
\begin{center}
All Individual Grade \textbf{OR} 2/3 Individual + 1/3 Group
\end{center}
Whichever is greater. It is possible to construct either random groups, or I can organize the groups based on grades to ``even out" the groups. Which would you prefer? Please circle your preference.
\begin{itemize}
	\item Random Groups
	\item Assigned Groups
	\item I don't care
\end{itemize}

In the event of a tie, I will use the results of the last vote (which was in favour of random groups) to determine the method. This means groups will be assigned randomly.
