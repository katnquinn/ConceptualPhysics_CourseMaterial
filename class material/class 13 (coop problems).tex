			\part The percent chance that you will draw a red ball?
				\vspace{0.3in}
			\part The percent chance that you will draw a blue ball?
				\vspace{0.3in}
			\part The probability that you will draw a red ball?
				\vspace{0.3in}
			\part The probability that you will draw a blue ball?
				\vspace{0.3in}
			\part The probability of drawing a red or blue ball?	
				\vspace{0.3in}

	\question Give an example of 2 statistically \textit{independent} events.

	\question Give an example of 2 statistically \textit{dependent} events.

	\question You toss a coin in the air 3 times. What is the probability that:
		\begin{parts}
			\part It will land heads all 3 times?
				\vspace{0.5in}
			\part It will land heads twice (and only twice)?
				\vspace{0.5in}
			\part It will land heads 2 or 3 times?
				\vspace{0.5in}
			\part It will land tails 2 or 3 times?
				\vspace{0.3in}
		\end{parts}
		
	
	\clearpage
\question You are tossing a fair coin, which has a 1/2 probability of landing heads and a 1/2 probability of landing tails. If you toss the coin in the air 300 times, how many times \textbf{on average} would you expect it to land:
	\begin{parts}
		\part Heads:
			\vspace{0.5in}
		\part Tails:
			\vspace{0.5in}
	\end{parts}
\question You are tossing a trick coin, which has a 2/3 probability of landing heads, and a 1/3 probability of landing tails. If you toss the coin 300 times, hoe many times \textbf{on average}	 would you expect it to land:
	\begin{parts}
		\part Heads:
			\vspace{0.5in}
		\part Tails:
			\vspace{0.5in}
	\end{parts}
	
\question Based on your answers to the two previous questions, how could you tell if a coin was fair (without any special equipment or knowledge of how coins can be biased)?
	\vspace{1in}
	
	\question There are 52 cards in a deck. You are dealt 2 cards (without refilling the deck). What is the probability that you will have both the ace of spades and the ace of diamonds?
		\vspace{1in}
	
	\question Why isn't it valid to define randomness by saying that randomness is when all outcomes are equally likely?

\question Suppose you have two identical loaded four-sided dice, with P(4) = 1/2, and P(1) = P(2) = P(3) = 1/6. 
\begin{parts}	
	\part If you rolled one die many times, what is the average value you would roll?
		\vspace{1in}
	\part If you rolled both dice there are 16 possible rolls you could get. What is the probability of each?
		\vspace{1in}
	\part If you add up the values of your two rolls, you could get between 2 and 8. What is the probability of each possible sum?
		\vspace{1in}
	\part What is the average sum you would get if you rolled both dice many times?
		\vspace{1in}
\end{parts}

\question Does the number of radioactive nuclei in a sample decrease to exactly half its original value in one half-life? Explain in terms of the statistical nature of radioactive decay.
	\vspace{1in}
	
	\question Describe the following kinds of radioactive decay;
		\begin{parts}
			\part Alpha decay:
				\vspace{0.3in}
				
			\part Beta decay:
				\vspace{0.3in}
				
			\part Gamma decay:
				\vspace{0.3in}
		\end{parts}
		
	\question You have a block of radioactive material, and measure the number of initial decays to be 128 million. If it has a half-life of 4 hours, what do you expect its radioactivity level to be after:
		\begin{parts}
			\part 4 hours?
				\vspace{0.3in}
			\part 8 hours?
				\vspace{0.3in}
			\part 16 hours?
				\vspace{0.3in}

	\question Does the number of radioactive nuclei in a sample decrease to exactly half its original value in one half-life? Explain in terms of the statistical
nature of radioactive decay.
	\vspace{0.5in}
		
	\question What distinguishes between:
		\begin{parts}
			\item Different kinds of elements?
				\vspace{0.3in}
			\item Different isotopes within an element?
				\vspace{0.3in}
		\end{parts}
		
	\question Physicists thought for a long time that bismuth-209 was the
heaviest stable isotope. (Very heavy elements decay by alpha emission because of the strong electrical repulsion of all their protons.)
However, a 2003 paper by Marcillac et al. describes an experiment
in which bismuth-209 lost its claim to fame â€” it actually undergoes
alpha decay with a half-life of $2\times 10^{19}$ years.
	\begin{parts}
		\part After the alpha particle is emitted (two protons and two neutrons), what is the isotope left over?
			\vspace{0.5in}
		\part Compare the half-life to the age of the universe, which is about
14 billion years.
			\vspace{0.5in}

	\question What is the source of energy emitted in radioactive decay? (Hint: think about conservation laws from before)

	\question What is the Heisenberg uncertainty principle?

	\question What is the concept of \textit{wave-particle duality}?
		\vspace{0.5in}
		
	\question How would the wavelength of an object change if:
		\begin{parts}
			\part Its mass increased?
				\vspace{0.3in}
			\part Its velocity decreased?
				\vspace{0.3in}
		\end{parts}
		
	\question Three particles of equal mass are traveling in the same direction. The waves of
the three particles are as shown.

	Rank the speeds of the particles ( I ), ( II ) and ( III ) by circling one of these four possibilities.

	\question According to the uncertainty principle, the more we know about an electron's position,
the less we know about its
\begin{choices}
	\choice speed.
	\choice momentum.
	\choice kinetic energy.
	\choice all of these.
\end{choices}

	\question A metal surface is struck with light of wavelength 400nm, releasing a stream of electrons. If the 400nm light is replace by a 300nm light with the same number of photons incident on the metal per second, what will happen?

\choice More electrons are emitted in a given time interval
\choice Fewer electrons are emitted in a given time interval
\choice Emitted electrons are more energetic
\choice Emitted electrons are less energetic
\choice None of the above
