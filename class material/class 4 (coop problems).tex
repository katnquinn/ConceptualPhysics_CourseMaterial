\question The Shinkansen is a network of high-speed railway lines in Japan. The trains reach a maximum operating speed of 320~km/h (200~mph), although in April 2015 one set the world record 603 km/h (375 mph).

One of these high-speed trains accelerates (assume constant acceleration) from rest at a station, reaching its maximum operating speed ($3.20\times 10^2$~ km/h) in 1.00~minutes. It continues to cruise at this speed for 10.0 minutes, then slows down to a stop during the course of one more minute to reach the next station (assume constant deceleration). After waiting 5 minutes for passengers to embark/disembark, it returns to its original stop by performing the same course in reverse: accelerating to $3.20\times 10^2$~km/h in 1.00~minutes, cruising for 10.0 minutes and slowing down to a stop in another minute.
